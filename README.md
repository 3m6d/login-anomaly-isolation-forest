# login-anomaly-isolation-forest

A project for detecting anomalous login attempts using the Isolation Forest algorithm.

## Overview

This repository aims to identify unusual or suspicious login activity by leveraging the Isolation Forest machine learning model. It's useful for applications where detecting outliers in authentication logs is critical for security monitoring.

## Features

- Detects anomalous login attempts.
- Utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm for unsupervised anomaly detection.
- Designed to work with login data (e.g., timestamps, user IDs, locations, etc.).
- Jupyter Notebook-based implementation for easy experimentation and visualization.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3m6d/login-anomaly-isolation-forest.git
   cd login-anomaly-isolation-forest
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Most of the code should run in a Jupyter environment with common Python data science packages. You can install typical requirements with:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
   ```

   If a `requirements.txt` file is added, use:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the notebook file(s) in this repository and follow the instructions in the code cells to load your login data and run anomaly detection.
